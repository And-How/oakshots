##Visualizing Shot Spotter Incidents in Oakland

This is a demo application that uses [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/), [Torque](https://github.com/CartoDB/torque) and crime incident data from the Oakland Police Department.

It was originally built at a [Code for Philly](http://codeforphilly.org/) civic application workshop by [Mark Headd](http://twitter.com/mheadd) and was redepolyed for Oakland by [Spike](http://twitter.com/spjika).

The visualization displays Shot Spotter incidents from 2008 through 2013 (5 years totaling 17,185 incidents, some of which are fireworks and now shootings).  The sensors for this system were not completely installed in 2008 and so many areas do not show incidents as a result of sensor locations- in 2013 you can see indicnets popping up in District 5 that previously did not get noticed.  The sensor system was improved over the years of operation by the vendor.
